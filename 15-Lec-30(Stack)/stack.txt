LIFO => Last in First Out
Items on one another
    New Item can be placed on top only
    Item can be retrieved from top only


Push --> Add element on top => O(1)
Pop --> Remove element from top => O(1)
Peek --> Retrieve element from top => O(1)

Can be implemented by:
    Array --> Fixed Size
    ArrayList --> Varibale size, easy to extend
    LinkedList --> each time new element is added, make it head or simply you can say addFirst.
