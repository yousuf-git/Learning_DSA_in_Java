If you want to stuck your head in building concepts of Data Structures in JAVA and make your problem solving skill better then you can enter this shit.

And if you are going to try to solve a problem yourseld then don't give it more than 30 minutes, after that it will be time wasting... simple see the solution and try to understand that logic or simply use chatGPT 

I did this practice from "Shardha Khapra" channel on Youtube
