Linked List => Nodes Connected to one another

Data Structure  |   Operation   |   Time Complexity

ArrayList           Insert          O(n) --> move all elements to make place for new
LinkedList          Insert          O(1) --> only adjuts pointers, constant operations

ArrayList           Search          O(1) --> element is directly accessible by index
LinkedList          Insert          O(n) --> traverse all index, non contiguous memory


Properties:
    Varibale size
    Non Contiguous memory location
    Made with node (data + next/poinnter)

First node --> head
Last node --> tail

Singular Linked List --> only move forward
Doubly Linked List --> can move forward or backward
Circular Linked List --> Last element points to first one
