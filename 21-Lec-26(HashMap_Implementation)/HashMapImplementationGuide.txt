Hash Map is implemented by array of linked lists

Hasing --> changing form of data
    Example : abc --> 6969

SHA1 SHA256


input --> hasCode() --> output
    same output for same input untill hashmap is same
 
if n nodes are divided into N buckets
    n/N = lambda <= k (Threshold Value)

if lambda > k --> rehasing 
    - increase size of buckets / array
    - put all nodes into new buckets



searchInLL()
rehash()
