----------HashMap is used to store key value pairs-------------

key : value
key is unique while values can be duplicated

Efficient data structure in term of time complexity

------------Different Methods in HashMap class------------

1. put(key, value)
    - To add a key value pair
    - If key already exists => its value is updated
    - If key doesn't exist already => new key value pair is added
    - Worst case Time complexity = O(n) => n is number of nodes
    - In avergae case = O(lamda) that is constant time

2. remove(key)
    - To remove a key and its value
    - nothing happens if key doesn't exist

3. get(key)
    - To get value against a key 
    - returns null if key doesn't exist

4. size()
    - To get size of HashMap
    - Total number of key-value pairs / entries

5. containsKey(keyName)
6. containsValue(value)
    - returns true if specific key/value exists, false otherwise

7. entrySet()
    - returns all entries of HashMap in the form of set
    - in that set, each entry has key and value

8. keySet()
    - returns all keys of HashMap in the form of set
    - elements of this set represent keys of Map
    - that keys can help to get values by using get(key) method
