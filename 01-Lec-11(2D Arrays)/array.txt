Array: Consecutive memory locations for same type of data
Array Size: size of array * unit size of data type 
    Example: int[] array = new int[5];  --> Size = 5*4 = 20 bytes

2D Array:  Matrix form 
[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]];

Order --> 3x3 ; No. of elements = 3*3 = 9
Size = No. of elements * 4 => 9*4 = 36 bytes
